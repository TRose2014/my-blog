    <h4>Back Story:</h4>
    <p>Back in March 2020 when I got laid off my first software developer job, I was determined to find a new job, and I would do just that. Recieving not one, not two but three different job offers!! I would start my new job in June 2020 throughout my time, learn so much and meet some fantastic people. Fast forward to July 2021, I would make the grave decision to leave my position because my husband would get an opportunity of a lifetime; A chance to work in Okinawa, Japan as a DOD civilian. At this point I was in my second trimester with our second kiddo and our first was 4 years old so we knew this would be an amazing experience for both of them, so how could we say no. So after a lot of paperwork, and one LONG flight, we would land in Okinawa September 2021. Now that we have lived here for a bit, I figured I would write about my discoveries.</p>

    <h2>5 Interesting Things about Okinawa</h2>

          When you think about Japan, you think about a nice bowl of hot, steamy ramen; fresh, sweet sushi; and fast effifcent trains. Well in Okinawa, not all of those are the case, specifically the trains. There is a monorail, but not much other than that. So if you want to get around Okinawa, and not spend an arm and a leg on taxis, you are going to need to drive. And bonus, in Okinawa they drive on the left side of the road. Now in my older age, my anxiety levels have risen a bit, and now that I have kids it's gotten worse, so when I found out I needed to drive on the other side of the road, needsless to say I was TERRIFIED. Being a <a href="https://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/english/html/travel_and_visa/visa/other-status-of-us-forces-agreement.html">SOFA Status</a>, it was something I had to get if I wanted to survive on this island. So after studying and passing the written driving test,after re-creating every possible accident I could get into numerous times in my head; I was ready to hit the road....but not literally. I practice driving around base until I felt comfortable and when I finally ventured out off base, I realized that driving on the left side actually made a lot of sense and felt more comfortable for me. Now I am not the perfect driver and am still getting use to how the locals drive and the narrow roads and windy/winedy turns but all my paniking was all for nothing. Such as life.
