    <h4>Back Story:</h4>
    <p>Back in March 2020,  I got laid off from my first software developer job due to the pandemic and I was determined to find a new one. And guess what? I would do just that!! Receiving not one, not two, but THREE different job offers!! By June 2020, I started my new software engineer job where I learned numerous things and met some fantastic people. Fast forward to July 2021, I would make the tremendous decision to leave my position for an opportunity of a lifetime. A chance to live in Okinawa, Japan! After years of applying, my husand was finally offered a position to work for the Department of Defense (DOD). At this point, I was in my second trimester with our second kiddo and our first was 4 years old so we knew this would be a great experience for both of them. So after a lot of paperwork, and multiple flights, we would land in Okinawa in September 2021. Now that we have lived here for a bit, I figured I'd write about my experience.</p>

          What is the first thing you think of, when you hear Japan? For me, it's a big bowl of hot, steamy ramen. But for others it might be fresh sushi, or fast and efficient bullet trains. All great answers, but when it comes to Okinawa, all of those aren't exactly the case.

          In Naha, the capital of Okinawa, there is a small monorail system, but outsite of that, locals rely on cars, motocycles and bikes to get around. So if you have places to go and don't want to  spend an arm and a leg on taxis, you are going to need to drive. And bonus points, in Okinawa they drive on the left side of the road! Due to having kids, my anxiety is already pretty high so when I found out I need to drive on the other side of the road, needless to say, I was TERRIFIED. Once I passed the written driving test, after re-creating every possible accident I could get into numerous times in my head, I was ready to hit the road....but not literally. I practice driving around base until I felt comfortable and when I finally ventured out off base, I realized that driving on the left side made a lot of sense and felt more comfortable. Now I am not the perfect driver and I'm still getting used to how the locals drive and the narrow roads and crazy turns but all my panicking was all for nothing. Story of my life.

      <li class="list-header"><h3>Not Your Classic Japanese Food</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Going back to the hot, steamy bowls of ramen, the food in Okinawa is vastly different than what you would find in mainland Japan. The signature dishes in Okinawa are Okinawan Soba and Taco Rice. Okinawan Soba is sort of like mainland ramen, but the noodles are a bit thicker than normal ramen, but not as thick as udon. The broth is normally made of pork broth and katsuo dashi and topped off with pork spare ribs. But depending on where you go, they can have pork spare ribs, or pork belly.</li>

      <li class="list-header"><h3>The Ice Cream Heaven</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>After you enjoy a nice bowl of Okinawan Soba or, if you are looking for a way to beat the Okinawan heat, then grabbing an ice cream is a smart treat. Nice ryhme, huh? The various flavors of ice cream is out of this world. You can get ice cream from convience stores (Family Mart, 7-11, Lawsons), grocery stores and the best ice cream store on the island, <a href="https://www.blueseal.co.jp/en/products/flavor/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Seal.</a> My personal favorite is Passion Fruit Sorbert, Pineapple Sorbert. My daughter loves the Tropical Marble.</li>

        <li>This section will come as no surprise to those who were already stationed in Okinawa. Yet, for those who are new to the island, The sheer number of bases on this small island is astonishing. 

        Some quick background on me: I am a Navy brat. Because of my dad's time in the Navy, my family was very fortunate to be able to live in Europe for more than a decade. So with that, I was able to visit and be a part of many bases. So believe me when I say, the bases in Okinawa are very unique. First off, you have many small bases. On the Marine/Navy side you have Camp Butler, which consists of various, separate bases. Yet, their biggest base is Camp Foster. On the Air Force side, you have Kadena Air Base. Now, I thought I have been on some pretty big bases, but nothing compares to these two, Kadena Air Base. The number of things you can do, the restaurants you can eat at, and anything else you would need is available. 
        
        As a Navy brat, who grew up on overseas bases, I know firsthand how limited your options could be. But when it comes to the two largest bases in Okinawa, you could stay on base your whole tour and it would suit your needs. But please don't, Okinawa is a beautiful place with a vibrant and unique culture. And you would be missing out.</li>
