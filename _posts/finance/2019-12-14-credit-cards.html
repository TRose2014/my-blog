    <h5><i>Side Note: </i> I worked for a credit union for over 5 years, so my experience is coming from the credit union side. Not a bank. If you have a bank as your primary institution, some of the following may not apply, though the idea is the same. It is important to understand the difference between <dfn title="A nonprofit-making money cooperative whose members can borrow from pooled deposits at low interest rates.">credit unions</dfn> versus <dfn title="Banks are for-profit, meaning they are either privately owned or publicly traded.">banks</dfn>. Please understand that this is just helpful, general advice, but you should always consult your financial advisor if you have questions regarding your specific situation.</h5>

      <li><b>Easier to get approved than other credit applications</b>
      </li>
        <ul>
          <li>During my time as a <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Career/Member-Services-Representative/What-Is-How-to-Become" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Member Service Representative</a> it was not uncommon for people to come to me and say they would not be able to get approved for a credit card because of their credit or lack thereof. But I would always encourage them to apply because it is a great way to build/repair credit. And guess what, a good 70% of them would get approved. Yes, your credit score will go down about 2ish points in the short run. But in the long run, if you do to get approved, it will help you and your credit exceptionally if utilized properly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>If you don’t get approved, try the secured credit card route</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Now I said, usually about 70% would get approved but what about the 30% who don’t. What would I tell them? Normally, I would recommend the secured credit card route. And if you never heard of a secured credit card it works like this:
            <ol>
              <li>You need to have a certain amount of cash that you can put into your savings, my institution, the minimum was $500.</li>
              <li> That money would go on hold in your account. So it’s still sitting in your account, it's just hidden from you. You don’t see this $500 in your available balance but it will reflect in your statement balance.</li>
              <li>The financial institution will then turn around and give you a credit card for $500 (or whatever amount you told them to hold). This amount is your credit limit. You can’t go over it. </li>
            </ol>
            
            When I am explaining this to members – definition they normally associate it as a prepaid card, it is similar but remember it is a CREDIT card and reports to the credit bureaus to help build credit; or if you don’t make your payments lower credit. So make sure you are using it wisely and making those payments on time. Now I will be honest with you, I have had one person come to me reluctant to do a secured card because they were denied for one at a bank. Throughout my 5+ years working at a credit union, I have never seen a secured card application be denied, I mean we are holding your own money after all. If you stop paying they will use the funds that are on hold to pay it and then suspend the card until you put more money in your account. So if you are considering going this route, talk to a credit union first. But again I am super biased towards credit unions so if you are married to your bank just make sure you get all the ends and outs. Other than credit card interest rates there are no fees associated with the secured credit card…but I can’t say the same for a bank.

      <li><b>Awesome way to build credit</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
              Ok so I have been talking a lot about credit how credit cards help increase your score, or lower it. But exactly how do credit cards actually help establish/build credit. When you make a charge on your credit card, depending on your bank or credit union you have somewhere between 21-25 days to pay that charge without accruing any interest. But, these institutions report to the credit bureaus at the end month. So let’s say you buy something from Target using your card and the next day you pay off that charge, bringing your credit card balance to $0. When your financial institution reports that your balance is $0 to the bureaus, that reflects negatively on you because they want you to use the credit card you have been given, but not use the whole amount. So what I normally recommend people do is whenever you use the card, obviously you want to pay on your credit card, but pay it down to where you still have a $5 or $10 balance on the card. Then when the institutions report to the bureaus, they can see that you are using the card but not your whole amount. A good rule of thumb is to make sure at the end of the month, you use no more than 30% of your credit card limit. So for example if your credit limit is $2,000, show a balance of no more than $600. Keep doing this each month, and you will see your credit score increase.

      <li><b>You should always use your credit card when you go shopping</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
              Look, this is the 21st century, technology is everywhere. Most people use it for good, but others use it for bad. It seems whenever you turn on the news some company’s system got breached whether it be Target, Walmart, or various other federal agencies. For this reason, I always recommend people to use their credit cards instead of their debit cards when shopping. If your credit card account got hacked, guess what those hackers are just using borrowed money from the financial institution. Once you recognize the fraudulent charges submit the fraud claim on the credit card, and go on about your day. Too many times I have helped people who came into the credit union because their debit cards were hacked and there are multiple fraudulent charges on their account. Instead of borrowed money being compromised, it is their actual money that was supposed to go to bills, groceries, daycare, etc. and they would tell me that was all the money I have, I need to pay rent and bills today, I need that money now! Unfortunately, not only do they have to wait for the transaction to post to their account, but then they have to submit the fraudulent claim and depending on the financial institution it can take anywhere from 2-10 business days. That’s a long time to be without your hard earned money. So trust me and do yourself a favor, just use your credit card for everything to save yourself a headache and stress.

      <li><b>Watch out for those fees</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
              So surprise alert! I am a pretty frugal person. I don’t spend my money until I have done the utmost research to ensure I get a good deal. So when it comes to fees, I make sure to understand them so I can avoid them at any cost. When it comes to annual fees, make sure that you will get the most out of your credit card. When it comes to building/repairing credit, there is no reason for you to get a card with an annual fee. Your main focus should be about building credit, nothing more. Now if you have established credit and are looking for credit cards that give more benefits then ensure it is an annual fee you can live with.

      <li><b>Think twice before closing that credit card</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
              So if you are one of those people that have a bunch of credit cards and are looking to consolidate them all you have two options. Do a balance transfer from one credit card to another or pay off the credit card balance and close the credit card for good. Which option you pick will depend on your situation, but if you are thinking about closing that credit card once the balance is $0, you may be making a huge mistake. Credit is very interesting and at the same time very confusing. One of the factors that go into determining your credit score is length of credit history. Let’s say Sue has 4 credit cards. The first credit card she got 20 years ago, the second she got 5 years ago, the third she got 2 years ago and the fourth she got last year. She is really tired of having so many credit cards, and wants to close some out. If she were to close out her credit card that she held the longest, it would have devastating effects on her credit. She could be guaranteed that her credit score would be lowered substantially. Now Sue could have a perfectly good reason to close out that credit card. Maybe she is going through a divorce and wants no ties to her ex-husband (happened with my mom). Regardless, Sue needs to understand the implications of her credit score. Now if Sue decided to close out the card she got last year or the one she got 2 years ago. Her credit score could still potentially lower, but not as drastic as if she closed out her oldest card. So be mindful if you decide to close out your credit cards. If possible the best approach might be to get your card down to $0 and to never use it again. That way the credit bureaus still see it’s open. If you go this route, you may have to occasionally use it from time to time to ensure your financial institution doesn’t close it on your behalf. This shouldn’t happen, but I have seen it from time to time.
