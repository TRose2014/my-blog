    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>So I passed my AWS Solutions Architect - Associate a few days ago and I figured it would be fitting to kick off my blog page and have this topic be my first post. The purpose of this post is to provide some tips and tricks for anyone who is studying for this exam  and help them pass on the first try</p>

    <h2>Why should I believe you?</h2>
    <p>A quick backstory of why I took this exam. I finished my <a href="https://apprenticareers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: contents">Apprenti</a> training about two months ago and just started my on-the-job training. My company is an AWS partner, and they needed a certain amount of people to get their Solutions Architect - Associate certification so that they can become a premier member. So normally, the requirements for the AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: contents">exam</a> suggest that the normal path is that you should first take the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam and also have at least 2 years of AWS experience and only then would you be ready for the Solutions Architect - Associate certification exam. So needless to say, passing this exam is not an easy task, especially if you are completely new to AWS. When I entered my on-the-job training we were told by our CTO that 10 people took the exam and 2 passed. Now to give the others credit, they missed it by one or two questions, but again I stress -- IT IS NOT EASY TO PASS THIS EXAM. Now I wasn't the only apprenti that started this job, there were a total of 4 of us. We had about 2 weeks to study for the exam, since we had to take it before Sept. 6th when AWS would announce their new premier partners. Our CTO recommended for us to take it twice, the first time to see the types of questions that were asked, and the second for us to hopefully pass. For me personally, I knew my study habits, having passed the Series 6 and Series 63 on the first try back in my banking days, I knew that 2 weeks would not have been enough. Instead, I figured I could study for 3 weeks, give it my all the first time and hope for the best. So that is what I did, I studied 40 hours a week (maybe a little more since I studied at home too) for 3 weeks, took my exam 2 weeks ago and passed with a 804/1000 - not too shabby. Now let me clarify, I was NOT familiar with AWS when I started studying. During our apprenti training, we briefly dabbled in AWS. We deployed a static site via elastic beanstalk but we had no real understanding of the intricate details that the exam requires you to know. Let me also clarify, that out of the 4 apprentis that were studying for the exam, only two of us passed, one got a 700 but needed a 720 to pass (so missed it by 1 or 2 questions) and I am not sure about the other's score but I am sure he was close. All of that being said, you can pass the exam if you have no AWS experience....but please understand, you are going to need to study, and study hard. Let me share the resources that helped me be successful.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I had no previous experience in AWS prior to taking the Solutions Architect - Associate certification, but I was able to pass it the first time. I wanted to tell anyone who would hear my story, so they can have some idea what to expect and be better prepared to take the exam. Make sure you review the resources I provided, take multiple practice exams, read those FAQs, and put in the hard work. If you do all this, you will be well equipped to pass the exam on the first try!</p>
