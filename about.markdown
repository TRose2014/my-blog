## About Me

Before discovering the wonderful world of coding, I used to work in the banking industry for over 5 years. I did it all, from account set-up to mortgage applications. But after a while, I knew I wanted something more from my career. It wasn't until I had my daughter that I decided to take the plunge and dive head first into teaching myself programming. Eventually my diligence paid off and I became part of a great program called Apprenti. I then survived 5 months of extreme technical training, earning the right to call myself an Apprentice Software Developer. When I am not coding, I love to travel, beat my husband in video games, and convince my toddler that there are more words in the English language other than no. I am always working on something new so be sure to come back and check them out.
